This is my old portfolio website, created in the year **2018** using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It showcases some of my early work and web development skills.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **HTML Files**:
  - `index.html`: The main landing page of the portfolio.
  - `contact.html`: A page to display contact information.
  - `profession.html`: A page detailing my professional experience and skills.

- **Assets**:
  - `background.png`: Background image used on various pages.
  - `programming-gif-unscreen.gif`: An animated GIF to add dynamic visuals to the site.

- **Source Files**:
  - **JavaScript** (`src/js/`): Contains scripts like `contact.js`, `profession.js`, and `script.js` for interactivity.
  - **CSS Styles** (`src/styles/`): Includes stylesheets `contact.css`, `profession.css`, and `style.css` to style different parts of the site.

## Purpose

This portfolio site is a reflection of my early days in web development. It demonstrates my foundational knowledge and approach to creating websites in the early 2000s.
